# Gundam Smash! Changelog
## Version: 1.1.0-beta
## Release Date: November 6, 2023

It's time for a new version! 1.1.0-beta! There's a couple things that have been added, so be sure to check out the brand new <#1171018025328201759> channel, <#1171018333827645541> channel, and <#1171017986883203073> channel if you have any issues!. Be sure to read the channel descriptions for each of them!   

### What's New? 🌟
- **Version Numbers**: Did you notice that you can see the version number for `Gundam Smash!` in the status field now? Pretty neat, right! That way you can easily check the change logs if there's been a rollback or something like that!
- **Cache Sweepers**: Cache sweeping has been implemented! The `Gundam Smash!` bot will automatically clean up its own cache every 15 minutes, hopefully that will help with some of that memory bloat!
- **Local Variables!**: There were a couple global variables left over from development, that's been changed up so that everything regarding your interaction will be stateless, meaning after you hit that `Quit` button, the game will forget you were ever even there! This will help with memory management and performance!

## Technical Roadmap 🖥️
- **Cloud Hosting**: The transition to the cloud is soon! There's been some hiccups, but it is still happening. 

### Known Bugs 🐛
- The minor inconsistencies in embed formatting on mobile devices are still under investigation. There is no update at this time.
